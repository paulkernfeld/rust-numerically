# Rust, Numerically

Learn Rust via exercises, with a focus on numerical programming.

These exercises are designed to pair with [The Rust Programming Language](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). For example, exercises beginning with `03` can be completed after reading chapter 3.

All exercises are in the `examples` directory. To run the exercise in `examples/03-00.rs`:

```
cargo run --example 03-00
```
